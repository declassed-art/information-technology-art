## The Onion Bridge

2022-12-06 Oil on MDF, 31.1x19.1 in (79x48.5 cm)

The source of inspiration emerged in August 2022 when Tor was banned in Russia.
Out of curiosity I checked accessibility of non-public Tor bridges for a couple
of weeks, but eventually they were all banned.
Of course, new ones emerge sometimes, but paid fags in the service of enemy homeland
regularly find and ban them. I'm not paid for my curiosity so I gave a shit.

But then I started [dtcm](https://declassed.art/repository/dtcm/) project,
and then [torcontrol](https://github.com/declassed-art/torcontrol)
and [dtcm2](https://github.com/declassed-art/dtcm2), and when they became
production ready this painting was finished, at last.
